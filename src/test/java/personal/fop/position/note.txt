The context is determined by the rest of the path.

you can define variable in your context, then used in later in another context.

<xsl:for-each select="list-item"> //begin a position context.
    <xsl:variable name="pos" select="position()"/>
    <fo:table-row> //I think it begin a new position context.
        <fo:table-cell>//I think it also begin a new position context.
        <fo:block background-color="{$legendColorValue[@id=$pos]}"> //use the position defined above
        ...
