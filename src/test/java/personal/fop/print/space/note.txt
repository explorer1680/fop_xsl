to print white space, you can use "&nbsp;", or you can use:

<fo:block ...>
    <xsl:value-of select=' '>
</fo:block>

if you want to print multiple space, following is not working:
<fo:block ...>
    <xsl:value-of select='       '>
</fo:block>


You have to using following property:
<fo:block ... white-space="pre">
    <xsl:value-of select=' '>
</fo:block>
