https://netjs.blogspot.ca/2015/07/how-to-create-pdf-from-xml-using-apache-fop.html

you can't reuse:
new StreamSource(new ClassPathResource("personal/fop/employees.xml").getInputStream())
it will have following error:
(Location of error unknown)java.io.IOException: Stream closed

you can reuse:
ClassPathResource("personal/fop/template.xsl").getFile()

Please note:
In employees.xml, there is a part:

    <abcdefg>
        I am here!
    </abcdefg>

and in template.xsl, the entry point is:
<xsl:template match="/root/employees">
so, that part is listed in the fop_test_run.fo by the built-in rule of xsl.
but, the pdf is display as expected.
