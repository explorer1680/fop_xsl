to break a page, you don't need to using new <fo:simple-page-master>
you can use page-break-before, page-break-after, page-break-inside.
please note, they are not tag, they are attribute.
example:
<fo:block page-break-after="always">

I think you can use <block> to group multiple paragraph together, and use page-break-inside=avoid to avoid page break between them.

and, you can also use keep-with-previous on following blocks to group multiple block together.

it seems if you put too many together, you will lost some of them.
