To have first page has different footer is easy, you use a new fo:page-sequence at beginning of the file.

To have last page has different footer is difficult, how to use xsl to check if it is last page?

There is a solution from FOP.

				<fo:page-sequence-master master-name="MainPage">
                    <fo:repeatable-page-master-alternatives>
                        <fo:conditional-page-master-reference
                                master-reference="FirstPage" page-position="first"/>
                        <fo:conditional-page-master-reference
                                master-reference="OtherPages" page-position="rest"/>
                        <fo:conditional-page-master-reference
                                master-reference="LastPage" page-position="last"/>
                    </fo:repeatable-page-master-alternatives>
                </fo:page-sequence-master>
                
In the last page's layout, you don't define footer, then the normal footer will not show in the last page, then you define your footer in the normal content.

Note, you have to define "first" in this section, otherwise, it will not work.

Furthermore, you can use this to have different layout for odd and even pages.
