<fo:static-content flowname="xsl-footnote-separator"> is used for define breaker in footnote.
you don't need to define "xsl-footnote-separator" in <fo:simple-page-master> and footnote is placed on bottom of page automatically.

you have to define <fo:inline> inside of <fo:footnote>, but the content can be empty.
I think the order in the footnote is the order you define them in the file, not the first number in the note.
